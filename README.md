# National Call Routing Framework

A secure call routing framework designed to combat digital arrest scams and fraudulent calls through advanced authentication and monitoring.

## Features

- **Dynamic Call Distribution (DCD)**: Optimizes call routing based on network conditions, load, and reliability metrics.
- **Least-Cost Routing (LCR)**: Implements cost-effective routing while maintaining quality of service.
- **STIR/SHAKEN Authentication**: Implements secure caller verification protocols.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Provides additional security layers for sensitive operations.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Monitors system performance and detects anomalies.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns and potential fraud attempts.

## Architecture

The framework implements a three-layer architecture:

1. **Edge Layer**: Handles incoming calls and initial authentication
2. **Core Layer**: Processes routing decisions and manages call flow
3. **Storage Layer**: Maintains system state and analytics data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the system by editing `config/system.js`
4. Start the framework:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
